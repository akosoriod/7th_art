                    <p>
                    7th@rt is a virtual tool researched, created and produced by the Foreign Languages Department to support the autonomous learning of English as a foreign language of under and postgraduates at Universidad Nacional de Colombia by making use of Cinema, the Internet and Virtual Learning environments, through learning activities aiming at  encouraging and developing anticipation, comprehension and extension macro abilities based on the characters, the settings, the topics and the plots of the films.

                    <br/>
                    In other words, 7th @rt is concerned with providing opportunities for autonomous learners to strengthen and to help foster positive attitudes to improve their knowledge of the English language, language skills and learning strategies. In this sense, it is a goal but more significantly it is an on-going process principled by the idea that learning a foreign language is not only a communicative and cooperative activity itself, but very importantly, an autonomous one. It therefore emphasizes the great need and importance of students' initiatives and contributions to their learning experience in the process of becoming autonomous learners.

                    <p>
                    The adaptation process of 7th @rt to the HTML5 language is carried out through a project of the Academic Affairs Office, Bogota Campus, as part of a macro project called "Strengthening of Academic Communicative Competencies (Reading and Writing) through Curriculum and Use of Foreign Languages" (Global Development Program 2013-2015), further continuing the research-creation study entitled 7th @rt Virtual Materials for Autonomous Learners (Research Affairs Office, Bogota Campus).
